        Chandrayaan-3, the third mission in the Chandrayaan program, successfully launched on July 14, 2023, from the
        Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. The mission's objectives include:
        Exploring the lunar south pole: This region is of particular interest because it contains water ice deposits,
        which could be a potential resource for future human missions to the Moon.
        Probing the lunar interior: The mission will use a combination of instruments to study the Moon's crust, mantle,
        and core.
        Investigating the lunar exosphere: The exosphere is the very thin atmosphere surrounding the Moon. The mission
        will study its composition and how it is affected by solar and cosmic radiation.
